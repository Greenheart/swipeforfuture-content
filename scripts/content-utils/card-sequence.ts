/**
 * TODO:
 *
 * 1) ✅ Create CardSequence with support for linking cards
 * - ✅ fix bug to only show final card in sequence once
 * - (maybe) fix removing unused flags after they have been used to trigger cards in the sequence
 *
 * 2) ✅ Add support to execute different modifiers on left and right (implemented by CardTree)
 *
 * 3) ✅ Add support for CardTree within the CardSequenuce. If a node is a CardTree, then recursively call the cardsFromTree() function to build that subtree.
 * 4) Add support for CardSequence within the CardTree. If a node is a CardSequence, then then recursively call the cardsFromSequence() function to build that subsequence.
 *
 * 5) Add support for combining multiple CardSequences within a CardSequence
